The Kubernetes Resume Challenge by Forrest Brazeal

Finally completed this project and I must say that this is a very educative, deep dive into the inner workings of kubernetes.

Directory structure
- Dockerfile - builds docker image for the website
- Dockerfile.db - builds docker image for the database
- /kubernetes/app - manifest files for the website
- /kubernetes/db - manifest files for deploying the mariadb database
